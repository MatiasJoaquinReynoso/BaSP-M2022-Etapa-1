## RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 4TH WEEK PROJECT

## What is Trackgenix?
```
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies,and has asked us to develop a web system that facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.
```
## The project
### Week 01
```
The objective of the first week was to create screensflows of a new page for the company Trackgenix on Figma.
```
### Week 02
```
Then the problem was to create an HTML file that has the same content as the landing created the first week.
```
### Week 03
```
We are going to style the html file created using css.
```
### Week 04
```
This week we had to style the landing from week 2-3 using flexbox. The styles must be responsive. What does responsive mean? is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
```
### Week 05
```
 We'll be working on basics concepts of Javascript. The challenge of this week is to solve the exercises of JS and make some fixes on index.html file of Week-04.
